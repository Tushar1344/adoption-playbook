# Question Framework for 3-6-12 Month Plan

*Answers captured January 2026*

## Section A: Current State and Resources

### A1. Team & Budget

**Questions:**
- Are you a team of 1, or do you have direct/dotted-line resources?
- What budget do you control for enablement, tooling, or programs?
- Are you building from scratch or inheriting existing infrastructure?

**Your Answer:**
> Working with the enablement team who is more directly responsible for enablement programs. Can create positioning guides, playbooks, best practice guides that aid adoption or lower friction for Field Engineers and GTM teams. Role is Adoption Architect Lead—focused on clarity and action, not direct program ownership.

### A2. Stakeholder Map

**Questions:**
- Who do you report to? (Product? GTM? Dual?)
- Which BU+1s are in initial scope?
- Do you have existing champions in Field, Product, or Sales leadership?

**Your Answer:**
> **Primary Stakeholders:** SVPs and VPs of Field Engineering
> 
> **Verticals in Scope:** Manufacturing, Retail, Health and Life Sciences, Financial Services, Digital Natives
> 
> **Scope:** Global
> 
> **Goal:** Get executive sponsorship to drive change in Apps adoption motion

### A3. Adoption Infrastructure Today

**Questions:**
- Is there existing adoption telemetry or dashboards for Apps?
- Where does adoption signal currently live? (SFDC, internal tools, spreadsheets, nowhere?)
- Any existing playbooks or enablement materials, even if incomplete?

**Your Answer:**
> **Existing Infrastructure:**
> - Weekly cross-functional forum with PM + Field + Specialists exists
> - Adoption team meets with product and field leaders regularly
> - Current briefings include: adoption signals, metrics, loss analysis, strategic wins
> 
> **Gaps:**
> - Apps Cookbook exists but shows only simple examples
> - Doesn't show "what good looks like"
> - Feedback mechanism can be improved to be more targeted and timely

---

## Section B: Urgency and Quick Wins

### B1. Top Friction Points

**Questions:**
- What are the 2-3 biggest adoption blockers you're seeing RIGHT NOW?
- Is the field actively avoiding Apps conversations? Why specifically?
- Any escalations or "hair on fire" accounts that could become proof-of-concept?

**Your Answer:**
> **Top 3 Blockers (Ranked):**
> 1. **Scalability and Cost Controls** - Faster spin up/down is KEY (Product gap)
> 2. **Security/Compliance** - Critical for AI-powered apps and regulated industries
> 3. **App Architecture Uncertainty** - Field needs enablement on application design patterns (not crucial right away)
> 
> **Lighthouse Opportunities:**
> - Strat Hunter Accounts are good opportunities
> - Target using: platform adoption, data gravity, AI maturity as signals

---

### B2. 90-Day Success Criteria

**Questions:**
- What explicit expectation or OKR have you been handed?
- What would make your sponsor say "this function is working"?

**Your Answer:**
> **North Star by Phase:**
> - **3-6 Months:** Strategic Wins - Clear decisive account wins focused around apps delivering clear business value
> - **6-9 Months:** Stronger attach rates to other SKUs and use cases
> - **12+ Months:** Improved coverage - Unique accounts that have deployed production apps
> 
> **90-Day Success = Strategic Wins that prove the hypothesis**

---

## Section C: Critical Evaluation Inputs

### C1. Product Strategy Assessment

**Questions:**
- What's your candid view on product-market fit today?
- Is there alignment between Product and GTM on who the ICP is for Apps?
- What's the biggest product gap that kills deals or adoption today?

**Your Answer:**
> **Product-Market Fit:** Early in journey. Product is less mature but organic growth ($5M→$70M) validates demand.
> 
> **Biggest Product Gaps:**
> - Scalability and cost controls
> - Faster spin up/down for app spaces
> - These are being addressed in roadmap

---

### C2. GTM Messaging Assessment

**Questions:**
- What's the current elevator pitch for Apps?
- Where's the biggest messaging gap: "why Apps at all" or "why Apps on Databricks"?
- How do you currently handle the Money/Mindshare/Maturity objections you mentioned?

**Your Answer:**
> **Elevator Pitch:**
> "Apps are Tip of the Spear for platform adoption: Apps can serve as the entry point and container to land workloads across ETL, DW, ML, AI Agents, and Operational use cases—driving influenced revenue, expanding growth rate of other SKUs, and far exceeding direct Apps revenue."
> 
> **Messaging:** Shared responsibility with Marketing and Product. Have meaningful influence.

### C3. Field Enablement Assessment

**Questions:**
- How big is the skill gap in FE for app design conversations?
- What does the current Apps Cookbook cover vs. what's missing?
- Are there any FEs who are already "Apps believers" you can leverage?

**Your Answer:**
> **Priority Training Topics (90-day):**
> | Topic | Priority |
> |-------|----------|
> | Security/governance patterns (credential passthrough, authN/Z) | 🔴 High |
> | App discovery workshop (cockpit/vertical/horizontal use cases) | 🔴 High |
> | Competitive talk track (Palantir + hyperscalers) | 🔴 High |
> | Reference architectures (frontend + backend patterns) | 🟡 Medium |
> | Cost and scaling guidance | 🟡 Medium |
> 
> **Apps Cookbook:** Shows simple examples but doesn't show "what good looks like"

---

## Section D: Strategic Choices

### D1. Land vs. Expand Focus

**Questions:**
- Should the 3-month focus be landing new Apps customers or expanding existing ones?
- Is the "tip of the spear" positioning validated, or is that aspirational?

**Your Answer:**
> **Top 2 App Archetypes for Next 6 Months:**
> 1. **Business Cockpit Apps** - Natural extension for customers with established lakehouse
> 2. **Deep Vertical Apps** - AI-powered, requiring strong analytical maturity; great for strategic lighthouse accounts where we need a beachhead
> 
> **Targeting Logic:**
> - Unity Catalog adoption → signals cockpit app opportunity
> - AI adoption → signals deep vertical app opportunity
> - Small team sizes / large business team presence → signals horizontal app opportunity

---

### D2. Attach Rate Definition

**Questions:**
- How should we measure influenced revenue from Apps?
- What workloads (ETL, DW, ML, AI Agents) have the strongest natural attach today?

**Your Answer:**
> **Attach Rate Definitions (Priority Order):**
> 1. "App-led deals where Apps was primary value narrative in MEDDICC notes / SFDC fields"
> 2. "Apps opportunity sourced, plus downstream workload expansion within 2 quarters"
> 3. "Apps deployed in account AND uses feature X (Lakebase / Unity / model serving) within 90 days"
> 
> **Credibility > Trackability** - Definition must be accepted by BU leaders

---

### D3. Partnership Prioritization

**Questions:**
- Which partnership type (ISVs, SIs, IDE) has the highest leverage in the next 6 months?
- Is there an existing SI or ISV relationship that's working we can double down on?

**Your Answer:**
> **Lighthouse Account Signals:**
> - Strat Hunter designation
> - Platform adoption level
> - Data gravity
> - AI maturity
> - Strong partner ecosystem
