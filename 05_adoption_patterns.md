## Archetype Targeting Matrix

Archetypes are **not mutually exclusive**—a customer may fit multiple patterns. Use signals to identify which archetypes apply:

| Signal | Cockpit | Vertical | Horizontal |
|--------|:-------:|:--------:|:----------:|
| **Unity Catalog adopted** | ✅ | | |
| **AI/ML maturity (models in prod)** | | ✅ | |
| **Large business user base** | ✅ | | ✅ |
| **Deep domain pain point** | | ✅ | |
| **Platform productivity needs** | | | ✅ |
| **Strong data gravity** | ✅ | ✅ | |
| **Executive sponsorship** | ✅ | ✅ | |
| **Small technical team** | | | ✅ |

**How to Use:**
1. Assess customer against each signal
2. Check which archetypes light up
3. Multiple ✅ = pursue multiple playbooks in parallel
4. Prioritize based on customer's stated priorities

## Use Case Qualification Framework

### Fit Assessment Questions

1. **Is the use case net-new or migration?**
   - Net-new → Good fit
   - Legacy migration → Not ready yet

2. **Does it leverage Databricks data gravity?**
   - Data already in Lakehouse → Strong fit
   - Requires new data onboarding → Okay fit
   - Data in competitor platform → Weak fit

3. **Does it require AI/ML?**
   - Yes, AI-powered → Differentiator
   - No AI needed → Still fits, but weaker moat

4. **Who is the end user?**
   - Business users → Good (expands addressable market)
   - Technical users only → Okay (platform extension)

5. **What's the governance requirement?**
   - Strict governance needed → Strong fit (moat)
   - Loose governance → Less differentiated

## Guided Selling Triggers

### Why Guided Selling Matters
FE often doesn't recognize Apps opportunities even when present. These triggers help identify when to bring Apps into the conversation.

### Conversation Triggers by Archetype

| Customer Says/Does | Apps Opportunity? | Archetype | Next Step |
|--------------------|-------------------|-----------|-----------|
| "We need a dashboard for executives" | ✅ Yes | Cockpit | Qualify: What decisions? What data? |
| "Our BI tool isn't working for business users" | ✅ Yes | Cockpit/Horizontal | Demo: Self-serve analytics app |
| "We have ML models but can't operationalize them" | ✅ Yes | AI App | Explore: Model serving in app layer |
| "We need real-time visibility into operations" | ✅ Yes | Cockpit | Qualify: What operations? Latency needs? |
| "Our industry has a unique problem no tool solves" | ✅ Yes | Vertical | Explore: Custom app opportunity |
| "Data team is bottleneck for business requests" | ✅ Yes | Horizontal | Demo: Self-serve data quality app |
| "We want to build a customer-facing portal" | ⚠️ Maybe | - | Check: Internal or external? (External = wait) |
| "We need to migrate our Java apps" | ❌ No | - | Defer: Not ready yet |
| "We need infinite scalability" | ❌ No | - | Defer: Vertical scaling only today |

### Account Signals to Watch

| Signal in Account | Apps Opportunity? | Why |
|-------------------|-------------------|-----|
| Unity Catalog adopted | ✅ Strong | Governance foundation ready |
| ML models in production | ✅ Strong | AI App opportunity |
| Business users requesting data access | ✅ Strong | Horizontal App opportunity |
| Large data footprint in Lakehouse | ✅ Strong | Data gravity for Apps |
| Executive sponsor identified | ✅ Strong | Top-down adoption path |
| Industry-specific pain point mentioned | ✅ Strong | Vertical App opportunity |
| No Databricks footprint | ❌ Weak | Cold start too hard |
| Legacy migration is priority | ❌ Weak | Not ready yet |

### How to Use Triggers

1. **Listen:** In every customer conversation, listen for trigger phrases
2. **Recognize:** Match triggers to archetype opportunities
3. **Qualify:** Use the Fit Assessment Questions (above) to validate fit
4. **Position:** If qualified, introduce Apps with honest positioning
5. **Demo:** Schedule App First Demo relevant to their vertical

### Trigger Adoption Tracking

| Metric | Definition | Target |
|--------|------------|--------|
| **Trigger Recognition Rate** | % of FE who can identify 3+ triggers | TBD |
| **Trigger-to-Opportunity Rate** | % of triggers that become qualified opportunities | TBD |
| **Opportunity-to-Win Rate** | % of Apps opportunities that close | TBD |

## Gaps to Address

- [ ] Build reference architectures for each archetype
- [ ] Create qualification playbook for field teams
- [ ] Identify and profile 2-3 lighthouse customers per archetype
- [ ] Develop demo assets for each pattern
- [ ] Define adoption metrics per archetype
