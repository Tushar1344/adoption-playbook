## Hypothesis-Action Connection

Each action in this plan tests one or more hypotheses. Use [12_traceability.md](12_traceability.md) for the full validation chain.

| Phase | Primary Hypotheses Tested | Decision Point |
|-------|---------------------------|----------------|
| **P1 (M1-3)** | H3 (FE Enablement), H6 (Metrics Align BUs) | Month 3: Is enablement working? Do BU leaders buy metrics? |
| **P2 (M4-6)** | H1 (Tip of Spear), H4 (Three Archetypes), H7 (Net-New) | Month 6: Is attach rate improving? Do archetypes hold? |
| **P3 (M7-12)** | H2 (Ecosystem Moat), H5 (SI vs FDE) | Month 9: Is SI pilot working? Is moat real? |

| Enablement doesn't change behavior | Medium | High | Exec mandate, measure completion + application |
| Product gaps block wins | High | Medium | Position for right use cases, manage expectations |
| BU leaders don't accept attach metrics | Medium | High | Start qualitative, build to quantitative |
| FE time constraints | High | Medium | Prioritize top accounts, leverage SI partners |

## Success Criteria by Phase

| Phase | You've Succeeded If... | You've Failed If... |
|-------|------------------------|---------------------|
| **P1** | 3+ strategic wins, exec sponsorship, enablement delivered | No wins, no exec buy-in, enablement not adopted |
| **P2** | Attach tracking live, playbooks used, 5+ wins | No tracking, playbooks ignored, pipeline stalled |
| **P3** | 50+ accounts, attach improved, SI motion started | Coverage flat, attach declining, no SI traction |
