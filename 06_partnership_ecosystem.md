## Partner Type 1: Internal FE Teams

### Role
Field Engineering teams (especially EPLs - Enterprise Platform Leads) serve as the front line for:
- **Signal capture** from customer conversations
- **Pattern identification** across accounts
- **Early warning** on adoption blockers
- **Feedback loop** to Product and Adoption Architect

### Current State

| Dimension | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Data/ML expertise | ✅ Strong |
| App development expertise | ❌ Gap |
| Signal capture process | ❓ Unknown |
| Feedback mechanisms | ❓ Unknown |

### Partnership Actions Needed

| Action | Purpose | Priority |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Enable FEs on app patterns | Close expertise gap | High |
| Create signal capture process | Systematic friction identification | High |
| Establish feedback cadence | Regular input to playbooks | Medium |
| Identify Apps champions in FE | Build internal advocates | Medium |

| **Cursor** | AI-assisted Databricks development |
| **Windsurf** | Modern IDE with Databricks integration |
| **Vercel** | Frontend deployment + Databricks backend |
| **Antigravity** | Emerging developer tools |

**Strategic Play:** Coding agents should easily integrate with Databricks and understand its services → Create an **opinionated, data-oriented IDE experience**.

#### B. AI/ML ISVs

| Partner Type | Opportunity |
|--------------|-------------|
| Vector DB providers | Integrate with Lakebase |
| LLM frameworks | LangChain, LlamaIndex integrations |
| Agent platforms | Native Databricks agent building |

#### C. Vertical SaaS ISVs

| Partner Type | Opportunity |
|--------------|-------------|
| Industry solution providers | Build on Databricks Apps |
| Analytics vendors | Embed Databricks as backend |

### ISV Partnership Actions Needed

| Action | Purpose | Priority |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Identify target IDE partners | Developer experience focus | High |
| Create Databricks SDK for IDEs | Enable seamless development | High |
| Develop partner certification | Quality control for Apps | Medium |
| Build ISV showcase program | Demonstrate ecosystem strength | Medium |

## Partner Type 3: System Integrators (SIs)

### Strategic Goal
Partner with SIs who lead with an **App-first GTM motion** to scale solution delivery.

### Ideal SI Partner Profile

| Dimension | Criteria |
|-----------|----------|
| **GTM Motion** | Leads with applications, not infrastructure |
| **Industry Focus** | Deep vertical expertise |
| **Databricks Expertise** | Existing partnership or willingness to invest |
| **Delivery Model** | Can build and operationalize Apps |

### SI Partnership Tiers

| Tier | Description | Investment |
|------|-------------|------------|
| **Strategic** | Co-sell, co-develop solutions | High |
| **Preferred** | Trained on Apps, joint marketing | Medium |
| **Registered** | Basic enablement, referral fees | Low |

### Competitive Dynamic

**Palantir's FDE Motion** is the competitive benchmark:
- Palantir deploys engineers directly with customers
- Creates deep, solution-oriented relationships
- Expensive but effective for land-and-expand

**Counter-Strategy via SI Partners:**
- SIs can provide FDE-like engagement
- More scalable than internal FDE build-out
- Leverage SI industry expertise
- Lower cost than Palantir's model

### SI Partnership Actions Needed

| Action | Purpose | Priority |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Identify App-first SIs | Find partners with right GTM motion | High |
| Create SI enablement program | Train on Apps architecture | High |
| Develop joint solution accelerators | Speed time-to-value | Medium |
| Establish co-sell motions | Align incentives | Medium |
| Build SI success stories | Prove partnership model | Medium |
